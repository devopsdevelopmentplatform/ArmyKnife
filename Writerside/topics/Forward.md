I started out with an old Packard Bell 386. I was in awe of what you could do with a computer. I knew computers were the future
so my friends and I build my next computer from scratch. I couldn't afford the 486 DX2 66, but I'm very thankful about the 
486 DX 33 we built. Once I learned how easy it was. I was off to the races building computers for everyone. 

During that time, it was before the internet was mainstream and easily accessible, so I enrolled in a few classes at the local 
community college. I took Pascal and C classes and received an A in both classes. My C programming teacher was so impressed he asked
If I was working as a programmer doing C all day long. I said yeah I wish LOL. I was too bashful to tell him I read 3 or 4 C programming 
books before I took the class. People used to laugh at me walking around at my telemarketing job all day with C programming books in my hand. 

At the time there was not much for a computer nerd to do except read books and magazines about computers and hang out on IRC all night
long. I remember dreaming of writing my first application while reading Byte magazine. I found out about a new 32 bit operating system called
Windows NT, and another one called Yagsdrill Linux. It was so exciting loading those 30 floppy disks to install the operating system. It took
hours. Soon they had weekly computer fairs where you could buy a cdrom with linux on it. That cut the time in half. 

I must have installed Windows NT over 1000 times. I turned into an expert in Windows overnight.

When the internet came out, you had to set up a modem and dial-up software. Windows NT had a TCP/IP stack built in, so I didn't have 
to use the garbage software Windows user had to use. Soon I was able to get Linux on the internet, and I was off to the races.

Over the years I spent my career learning everything I could. I moved from Desktop Administrator to Systems Admin to Systems Engineer
to Web Developer to DBA and Network Architect. I had a passion for doing Network Security. 

About 13 years ago I landed a job as a Linux Systems Engineer. I had been using server hosting providers in the datacenter for my
personal projects for years but when I learned about AWS, I was hooked. I was doing click-ops and had no idea that it could be automated.
When I found out, I knew it was time to put my bash and python skills to work as a Cloud/DevOps Engineer.

Fast forward to the last 5 years and I was fortunate to accelerate my career to a Lead DevOps Engineer/Manager.

I've had the privilege of leading a team of talented Cloud and DevOps engineers. This experience has not only deepened my understanding 
of the diverse career stages we all navigate, but also clarified the daily manifestations of success and diligence.
In this journey, I've identified the key attributes that distinguish a top-tier DevOps Engineer and the essential skills required for success.

There's an ongoing debate about the skills gap in the DevOps field. Do we expect DevOps engineers to be superhuman,
capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound? Perhaps. My observations suggest that the most
effective DevOps engineers tend to adopt a software developer's mindset rather than one focused solely on operations—a distinction
that might be likened to the difference between left-brain and right-brain thinking.

What qualifies me to speak about the daily routines, learning priorities, and toolkits of DevOps Engineers? My career
has been a journey of continuous learning, fueled by collaboration with exceptionally skilled software developers.
From these experiences, I've adopted a philosophy of resilience—never giving up, always absorbing knowledge,
and leveraging every success and failure to propel forward. Leading a team has further refined my understanding of the
skills and competencies essential for a DevOps engineer.
