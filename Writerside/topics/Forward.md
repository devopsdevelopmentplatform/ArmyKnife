My career started in the late 80's early 90's building my own computers in the garage. I started out with the early versions of
Windows and Windows NT 3.1. I must have installed it 1000 times trying to learn every feature and every application Windows NT had to offer.
It was challenge trying to get Windows NT and Linux working with a dialup modem to say the least. Once the internet was mainstream, a computer had
no other purpose if it was not connected to the internet.


With over 25 years in IT, including the last 12 as a Cloud/DevOps Engineer and the most recent five as a Lead DevOps Engineer,
I've navigated numerous challenges and learning opportunities. My insights are shaped by both my successes and my mistakes.

Over the past few years, I've had the privilege of leading a team of talented Cloud and DevOps engineers.
This experience has not only deepened my understanding of the diverse career stages we all navigate but also clarified the
daily manifestations of success and diligence. In this journey, I've identified the key attributes that distinguish 
a top-tier DevOps Engineer and the essential skills required for success.

There's an ongoing debate about the skills gap in the DevOps field. Do we expect DevOps engineers to be superhuman,
capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound? Perhaps. My observations suggest that the most
effective DevOps engineers tend to adopt a software developer's mindset rather than one focused solely on operations—a distinction
that might be likened to the difference between left-brain and right-brain thinking.

What qualifies me to speak about the daily routines, learning priorities, and toolkits of DevOps Engineers? My career
has been a journey of continuous learning, fueled by collaboration with exceptionally skilled software developers.
From these experiences, I've adopted a philosophy of resilience—never giving up, always absorbing knowledge,
and leveraging every success and failure to propel forward. Leading a team has further refined my understanding of the
skills and competencies essential for a DevOps engineer.
