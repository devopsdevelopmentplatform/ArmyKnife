# PreFace

Recently, while starting a new multi-cloud project, I found myself reflecting over breakfast. My goal was to streamline my thoughts and strategize the path forward. I've always been drawn to multi-cloud solutions because they allow you to leverage the best tools from each provider, rather than being confined to a single ecosystem. However, the deeper I delved into the project, the clearer the challenges became. It's evident why many companies hesitate to adopt multi-cloud strategies—complexity is a major barrier. Managing multiple cloud tools and inventories can quickly become overwhelming.

This realization inspired me to create what I call the Multi-Cloud Manager—an API-driven repository of settings, concepts, and commands that facilitate cloud management globally.

The initial setup of my machine with the necessary tools seemed daunting. This challenge sparked the idea for ArmyKnife, a framework designed to automate and simplify the deployment of development environments. Why not have everything ready at your command?

How often do you find yourself needing to integrate Terraform with Vault for credentials, or deploy to a Kubernetes cluster when the setup isn't even on your local machine? Many have the luxury of a provided development environment, but not everyone. That's where ArmyKnife shines—it's not just a learning platform, but once set up, it becomes an accelerated DevOps productivity tool. It includes novel tools and examples to push your boundaries and enhance your skills.

For optimal setup, I recommend starting with a clean installation of Ubuntu or macOS. The installation scripts for ArmyKnife are designed with minimal pre-installed tools—just make, git, wget, and curl. I've gone a step further by creating custom apt and Homebrew repositories to keep ArmyKnife updated with tools not found in standard repositories.

Imagine setting up your workstation to automatically install Python, Go, and Rust—think of it as your technical "Kung Fu" training. Each installation comes with a "jump start" scenario based on best practices, designed to ease you into new concepts and tools. Whether you're a budding DevOps professional or refreshing your skills, ArmyKnife encourages you to experiment—create command-line apps, develop full applications with robust backends, and much more.

The workstation setup focuses on essential DevOps languages like Bash, Python, Go, and Rust, giving you ample opportunity to learn by doing. If you're unfamiliar with these tools, don't worry—it's a common starting point, and ArmyKnife is the perfect guide to help you ace your next interview.

Moreover, I've incorporated a full Kubernetes cluster setup into the platform. This was born from a challenging interview experience that made me realize every DevOps engineer should be proficient in managing complex K8s environments, regardless of the cloud service used. For those with limited resources, alternatives like minikube are also supported.

ArmyKnife also offers templates for Python, Go, and Rust command-line applications, and best practices for CI/CD scripting. A task in the makefile sets up a local docker registry for fast, local development cycles, ensuring everything is tested thoroughly before going live.

One exciting addition is a custom Geodesic docker image, which, despite its size, packs every tool needed for cloud development and security assessments. We're even developing a DevOps-focused Linux distribution based on Ubuntu, adapting as the platform evolves.

ArmyKnife isn't just a tool—it's a career accelerator, designed to make you the best DevOps engineer you can be.
