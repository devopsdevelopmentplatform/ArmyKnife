Once you've made changes to the submodule (in this case, `Ansible`) and you want to ensure these changes are reflected in the main repository (`ArmyknifeAI`), you follow a two-step process. First, you commit and push changes within the submodule, and then you update the reference in the main repository to point to the new commit of the submodule. Here's how you do it:

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes in the Submodule

1. **Navigate to the Submodule Directory**: Since you've cloned the `Ansible` repository separately, you're already in the right place.

2. **Check the Status and Add Changes**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit the Changes**: Commit your changes with an appropriate message.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
   ```

4. **Push the Changes**: Push the changes to the remote repository of the submodule.
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

### Step 2: Update the Main Repository to Point to the New Submodule Commit

After pushing your changes in the submodule, you need to update the main repository (`ArmyknifeAI`) so it points to the new commit of the submodule. This is because the main repository tracks a specific commit of each submodule.

1. **Navigate to the Main Project Directory**: If you're working in the same local environment, switch to the directory of your main project (`ArmyknifeAI`). If the main project is not already cloned locally, you need to clone it first.
   
2. **Pull the Latest Changes**: It's a good practice to ensure you're working with the latest version of the main project.
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

3. **Update the Submodule**: In the main project directory, update your submodule to ensure it's at the latest commit. This step is especially crucial if you've made changes directly in the submodule's own repository or if there are multiple contributors.
   ```bash
   git submodule update --remote --merge
   ```

4. **Stage the Submodule Update**: Git will now see the new commit reference for your submodule as a change to be committed in the main project.
   ```bash
   git add Tier1/Ansible
   ```

5. **Commit and Push the Update**: Commit this update, which is essentially a pointer to the new commit in the submodule, and then push the commit to the main project repository.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Updated Ansible submodule to latest commit."
   git push
   ```

This process ensures that anyone who clones your `ArmyknifeAI` project and its submodules will receive the latest version of the `Ansible` submodule. 

### Key Points to Remember

- **Submodule Commits**: When you commit changes within a submodule, those changes are specific to the submodule's repository. The main project tracks these changes as a reference to a specific commit in the submodule.
- **Updating Main Project**: After making changes to a submodule, you must manually update the main project to point to the new commit of the submodule. This step is crucial for keeping the project in sync.

By following these steps, you maintain a coherent state between your main project and its submodules, ensuring that all contributors are working with the latest versions.
